What is the area of this rectangle? \n###Output:\nTo find the area of the rectangle, we first need to determine its length. We can use the perimeter to find the length.\n\nThe formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:\nP = 2 * (length + width)\n\nWe know the perimeter is 28 cm and the width is 6 cm, so we can set up the equation:\n28 = 2 * (length + 6)\n\nNow, we solve for = 28) cm 6 cm,2 the length:\n28 = 2 * length + 12\n28 - 12 = 2 * length\n16 = 2 * length\nlength = 16 / 2\nlength = 8 cm\n\nNow that we have the length, we can find the area (A) of the rectangle using the formula:\nA = length * width\n\nSubstitute the values we have:\nA = 8 * 6\nA = 48 cm\u00b2\n\nThe area of the rectangle is 48 square centimeters.</s></s>", "t_len": 287}]}, {"152": ["Nothing"]}, {"153": ["Nothing"]}, {"154": ["Nothing"]}, {"155": ["Nothing"]}, {"156": ["Nothing"]}, {"157": ["Nothing"]}, {"158": ["Nothing"]}, {"159": ["Nothing"]}, {"160": ["Nothing"]}, {"161": ["Nothing"]}, {"162": ["Nothing"]}, {"163": ["Nothing"]}, {"164": ["Nothing"]}, {"165": ["Nothing"]}, {"166": ["Nothing"]}, {"167": ["Nothing"]}, {"168": ["Nothing"]}, {"169": ["Nothing"]}, {"170": ["Nothing"]}, {"171": ["Nothing"]}, {"172": ["Nothing"]}, {"173": ["Nothing"]}, {"174": ["Nothing"]}, {"175": ["Nothing"]}, {"176": ["Nothing"]}, {"177": ["Nothing"]}, {"178": ["Nothing"]}, {"179": ["Nothing"]}, {"180": ["Nothing"]}, {"181": ["Nothing"]}, {"182": ["Nothing"]}, {"183": ["Nothing"]}, {"184": ["Nothing"]}, {"185": ["Nothing"]}, {"186": ["Nothing"]}, {"187": ["Nothing"]}, {"188": ["Nothing"]}, {"189": ["Nothing"]}, {"190": ["Nothing"]}, {"191": ["Nothing"]}, {"192": ["Nothing"]}, {"193": ["Nothing"]}, {"194": ["Nothing"]}, {"195": ["Nothing"]}, {"196": ["Nothing"]}, {"197": ["Nothing"]}, {"198": ["Nothing"]}, {"199": ["Nothing"]}, {"200": ["Nothing"]}, {"201": ["Nothing"]}, {"202": ["Nothing"]}, {"203": ["Nothing"]}, {"204": ["Nothing"]}, {"205": ["Nothing"]}, {"206": ["Nothing"]}, {"207": ["Nothing"]}, {"208": ["Nothing"]}, {"209": ["Nothing"]}, {"210": ["Nothing"]}, {"211": ["Nothing"]}, {"212": ["Nothing"]}, {"213": ["Nothing"]}, {"214": ["Nothing"]}, {"215": ["Nothing"]}, {"216": ["Nothing"]}, {"217": ["Nothing"]}, {"218": ["Nothing"]}, {"219": ["Nothing"]}, {"220": ["Nothing"]}, {"221": ["Nothing"]}, {"222": ["Nothing"]}, {"223": ["Nothing"]}, {"224": ["Nothing"]}, {"225": ["Nothing"]}, {"226": ["Nothing"]}, {"227": ["Nothing"]}, {"228": ["Nothing"]}, {"229": ["Nothing"]}, {"230": ["Nothing"]}, {"231": ["Nothing"]}, {"232": ["Nothing"]}, {"233": ["Nothing"]}, {"234": ["Nothing"]}, {"235": ["Nothing"]}, {"236": ["Nothing"]}, {"237": ["Nothing"]}, {"238": ["Nothing"]}, {"239": ["Nothing"]}, {"240": ["Nothing"]}, {"241": ["Nothing"]}, {"242": ["Nothing"]}, {"243": ["Nothing"]}, {"244": ["Nothing"]}, {"245": ["Nothing"]}, {"246": ["Nothing"]}, {"247": ["Nothing"]}, {"248": ["Nothing"]}, {"249": ["Nothing"]}, {"250": ["Nothing"]}, {"251": ["Nothing"]}, {"252": ["Nothing"]}, {"253": ["Nothing"]}, {"254": ["Nothing"]}, {"255": ["Nothing"]}, {"256": ["Nothing"]}, {"257": ["Nothing"]}, {"258": ["Nothing"]}, {"259": ["Nothing"]}, {"260": ["Nothing"]}, {"261": ["Nothing"]}, {"262": ["Nothing"]}, {"263": ["Nothing"]}, {"264": ["Nothing"]}, {"265": ["Nothing"]}, {"266": ["Nothing"]}, {"267": ["Nothing"]}, {"268": ["Nothing"]}, {"269": ["Nothing"]}, {"270": ["Nothing"]}, {"271": ["Nothing"]}, {"272": ["Nothing"]}, {"273": ["Nothing"]}, {"274": ["Nothing"]}]}, {"batch-2": [{"0": ["Nothing"]}, {"1": ["Nothing"]}, {"2": ["Nothing"]}, {"3": ["Nothing"]}, {"4": ["Nothing"]}, {"5": ["Nothing"]}, {"6": ["Nothing"]}, {"7": ["Nothing"]}, {"8": ["Nothing"]}, {"9": ["Nothing"]}, {"10": ["Nothing"]}, {"11": ["Nothing"]}, {"12": ["Nothing"]}, {"13": ["Nothing"]}, {"14": ["Nothing"]}, {"15": ["Nothing"]}, {"16": ["Nothing"]}, {"17": ["Nothing"]}, {"18": ["Nothing"]}, {"19": ["Nothing"]}, {"20": ["Nothing"]}, {"21": ["Nothing"]}, {"22": ["Nothing"]}, {"23": ["Nothing"]}, {"24": ["Nothing"]}, {"25": ["Nothing"]}, {"26": ["Nothing"]}, {"27": ["Nothing"]}, {"28": ["Nothing"]}, {"29": ["Nothing"]}, {"30": ["Nothing"]}, {"31": ["Nothing"]}, {"32": ["Nothing"]}, {"33": ["Nothing"]}, {"34": ["Nothing"]}, {"35": ["Nothing"]}, {"36": ["Nothing"]}, {"37": ["Nothing"]}, {"38": ["Nothing"]}, {"39": ["Nothing"]}, {"40": ["Nothing"]}, {"41": ["Nothing"]}, {"42": ["Nothing"]}, {"43": ["Nothing"]}, {"44": ["Nothing"]}, {"45": ["Nothing"]}, {"46": ["Nothing"]}, {"47": ["Nothing"]}, {"48": ["Nothing"]}, {"49": ["Nothing"]}, {"50": ["Nothing"]}, {"51": ["Nothing"]}, {"52": ["Nothing"]}, {"53": ["Nothing"]}, {"54": ["Nothing"]}, {"55": ["Nothing"]}, {"56": ["Nothing"]}, {"57": ["Nothing"]}, {"58": ["Nothing"]}, {"59": ["Nothing"]}, {"60": ["Nothing"]}, {"61": ["Nothing"]}, {"62": ["Nothing"]}, {"63": ["Nothing"]}, {"64": ["Nothing"]}, {"65": ["Nothing"]}, {"66": ["Nothing"]}, {"67": ["Nothing"]}, {"68": ["Nothing"]}, {"69": ["Nothing"]}, {"70": ["Nothing"]}, {"71": ["Nothing"]}, {"72": ["Nothing"]}, {"73": [{"seq": "<s> ###Input:\nYou want to divide 1 liter (L) of water and 4 liters (L) of water equally into bottles of the same shape and size.

If Social Studies is 90 points and Physical Education is 95 points, what is the average score for Korean, English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Physical Education? \n###Output:\nTo find the average score for Korean, English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Physical Education, we first need to find the total score for Korean, English, and Mathematics. Since the average score for these three subjects is 92 points, we can calculate the total score by multiplying the average by the number of subjects:\n\nTotal score for Korean, English, and Mathematics = Average score \u00d7 Number of subjects\nTotal score for Korean, English, and Mathematics = 92 points \u00d7 3 subjects\nTotal score for Korean, English, and Mathematics = 276 points\n\nNow we add the scores for Social Studies and Physical Education to this total:\n\nTotal score for all five subjects = Total score for Korean, English, and Mathematics: \u00d7 1 \u00d74 \u00d7 2 \u00d7  + Social Studies score + Physical Education score\nTotal score for all five subjects = 276 points + 90 points + 95 points\nTotal score for all five subjects = 461 points\n\nFinally, we divide this total score by the number of subjects (5) to find the new average:\n\nAverage score for all five subjects = Total score for all five subjects \u00f7 Number of subjects\nAverage score for all five subjects = 461 points \u00f7 5 subjects\nAverage score for all five subjects = 92.2 points\n\nTherefore, the average score for Korean, English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Physical Education is 92.2 points.</s></s>", "t_len": 399}]}, {"231": ["Nothing"]}, {"232": ["Nothing"]}, {"233": ["Nothing"]}, {"234": ["Nothing"]}, {"235": ["Nothing"]}, {"236": ["Nothing"]}, {"237":
