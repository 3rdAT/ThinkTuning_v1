How much amount of money is when you sum up the coins placed around the circumference? \n###Output:\nTo find the amount of money around the circumference of the rectangle, we need to count the coins along the edges without counting the corners twice.\n\nThere are 6 coins along the horizontal edge, but we only count the 4 in between the corners for each of the two horizontal edges, which gives us 4 + 4 = 8 coins.\n\nThere are 4 coins along the vertical edge, but we only count the 2 in between the corners for each of the two vertical edges, which gives us 2 + 2 = 4 coins.\n\nNow we add the corners. There are 4 corners, with one coin at each corner, so we have 4 coins.\n\nAdding these up, we have 8 (horizontal in-between) + 4 (vertical in-between) + 4 (corners) = 16 coins.\n\nSince each coin is worth 100 won, the total amount of money around the circumference is 16 coins * 100 won/coind, which is 1,600 won in Korean won:\n\n1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won.\n\n1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won. 1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won in decimal form.\n\n1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won in decimal form.\n\n1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won in decimal form.\n\n1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won in decimal form. 1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won in Korean won in decimal form:\n\n1,600 won is equal to 1,600 won inin = 1600 won.</s>", "t_len": 496}, {"seq": "<s> ###Input:\nA rectangle was created by arranging 6 100-won coins horizontally and 4 vertically.
